	Recipes:

		Pulveriser - 2 inputs three outputs. One input is always water:

			Bauxite ore + water -> Bauxite dust + 2 Iron dust
			Stone + Water -> Salt, Lime, Sand
			Coal + water -> graphite sludge

		Chemical Plant

			Salt + water -> Chloride (Cl2) + Sodium (2Na)  --- Could in time turn this into a downs cell.
			Sodium + Water -> NaOH + H2
			H2 + Cl2 -> HCl
			Sodium Alumate + Al(OH)3 (In ideal world, this does not get used up in the reaction) + Water -> Aluminium Hydroxide
			
	

		Vacume oven/Rotary kiln - one (maybe two?) items together with petroleum gas as fuel -- very long production time but 
			      high production amount per cycle
			
			Coal + petroleum gas -> Cokes
			Lime + petroleum gas -> Cement
			Wood + petroleum gas -> Coal
			Aluminium Hydroxide + petroleum gas -> Alumina
		
		Mixer

			Cement + sand + water + Stone -> concrete
			Bauxite dust + NaOH + Lime -> Sodium Alumate

		Assembler
			
			Steel -> rebar
			Rebar + concrete -> Concrete wall


		Furnace 
			
			Graphite sludg -> graphite bar

		Assembler
		
			Graphite bar + Ceramic + coke rods -> Hall-Heroult reaction chamber
